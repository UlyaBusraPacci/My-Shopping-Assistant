# My-Shopping-Assistant

This project is an AI-powered chatbot integrated into a website, built using OpenAI's assistant models. The chatbot provides users with information about pages and clothing items available on the site. For example, when asked, "Is there a red sweater?" the bot responds accurately based on the data associated with the site. It enhances user experience by offering quick and relevant answers, making it a valuable addition to e-commerce platforms.
